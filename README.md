### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Simon the Lead Android Developer at [Host Building](https://host.cbre.com/en/host-building).

Whenever I get an idea, I'm prone to starting a repo and working for a couple of hours before abandoning it. So most of my public repositories are filled with _bad code_ ðŸ˜± that I'll fix up and turn in to nice little repos for functioning apps one day when I get the time... ðŸ˜”

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Mavericks](https://github.com/airbnb/mavericks/)
